* uniswap
* testenv
* utils


## bclient

Provides a wrapper around the `ethclient` package

## bindings

Provides code generated by abigen for working with smart contracts:

* `bindings/erc20` provides generated code for working with ERC20 contracts
* `bindings/oneinch/v2` provides generated code for working with OneInch V2 router contracts
* `bindings/oneinch/v3` provides generated code for working with OneInch V3 router contracts
* `unicrypt/presalefactory` provides generated code for working with UniCrypt presale factories
* `uniswap/*` provides generated code for working with Uniswap V2 contracts (note these can also be used for working with the corresponding sushiswap contracts)

## cli

cli package

## config

configuration management package

## database

database management packlage

## sushiswap

Wrapper around go-ethereum's `ethclient` package for using sushiswap v2.

## uniswap

Wrapper around go-ethereum's `ethclient` package for using uniswap v2. 

## testenv

Provides a wrapper around the SimulatedBackend allowing for an in-memory blockchain. It is particularly useful for local smart contract development, or developing backend dApps.

## utils

Provides utility functions including all [goethereum book utils](https://goethereumbook.org/en/util-go/), a helper to make `bind.TransactOpts` safe for concurrent use, as well as a general `Blockchain` interface that satisfies all functions provided by simulated backend, as well as `ethclient` which is useful for drop-in replacement of actual RPC clients, and test environments.
